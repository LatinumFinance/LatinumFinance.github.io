# Latinum Finance

Latinum Finance allows you to earn passive income on your current cryptocurrency holdings. When you stake crypto, your assets go towards verifying transactions
and  securing the network. To incentivize staking, the network generates rewards and pays them out to stakers. Staking is the best option for customers looking
to earn passive rewards on their crypto assets! More information about staking and rewards here: [Staking Rewards System](./CosmosEcosystem)  

## Registering a Ecosystem

> Step 1:
> 

Join the Discord Server

`Discord Server : 987987987`

>Step 2:
>

Click the `"Make a Ecosystem"` tab in Discord and send the requested information.(name of ecosystem, wallet address's, etc...) 
Congratulations! You have just created your Latinum Finance Ecosystem! 


## Building your Ecosystem

>Step 1:
>

Choose your favorite crypto ecosystem and token that you want to stake!

>Step 2:
>

Locate that token on the Latinum Finance website to double check the availability, network used, wallet address and required token send quantity.

>Step 3:
>

Purchase a planet for your crypto ecosystem by sending the exact amount of tokens to the listed wallet address to be staked for passive income rewards!


`*USE THE SAME WALLET ADDRESS YOU USED TO REGISTER YOUR ECOSYSTEM ON DISCORD*`

`*MAKE SURE TO SEND YOUR TOKENS TO THE CORRECT WALLET ADDRESS USING THE RIGHT NETWORK! FUNDS SENT TO THE WRONG ADDRESS OR OVER THE WRONG NETWORK CAN NOT BE RECOVERED*`

_*Orders recieved that differ from the amount total or do not match any registered wallet adresses will be sent back to the same address less the gas cost used*_

`*All STAKED TOKENS CAN BE UNSTAKED AT ANY TIME BUT REQUIRE CERTAIN UNSTAKING TIME PERIODS*` 

Find out more about unstaking your assets here: [Unstaking my Assests](./CosmosEcosystem)

>Step 2:
>

Congratulations! The unstaking process has begun! Now just wait for your tokens to arrive in your registered wallet once the unstaking process has completed.

**REMEMBER YOU MUST WAIT THE FULL DURATION OF THE UNSTAKING WAIT PERIOD!**

`ALL ASSETS HAVE DIFFERENT UNSTAKING WAIT PERIODS! WE ARE UNABLE TO EXPEDITE THIS PROCESS! YOU MUST WAIT THE FULL DURATION OF THE UNSTAKING WAIT PERIOD!` 

You can check the status of your Unstaking period here: [Maybe I can ?](./CosmosEcosystem)
