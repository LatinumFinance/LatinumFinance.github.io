## Start Earning Passive Income Today! 


Latinum Finance allows you to earn passive income on your current cryptocurrency holdings by staking them and auto compounding the interest reward every 7 days to generate maximum yield. When you stake crypto, your assets go towards verifying transactions and securing the network. To incentivize staking, the network generates rewards and pays them out to stakers. Staking is the best option for people looking to earn passive rewards on their crypto assets! More information about staking and rewards here: [Staking Rewards System](./CosmosEcosystem) 


Then, whenever you are ready, you can unstake your usdt balance to get your staked balance plus the interest you gained over the duration of the staked period. Payouts are done by converting your current USDT balance into Litecoin(LTC) and sending it to your LTC wallet address of choice. Litecoin offers extermely low transaction fees and is accepted by nearly all crypto exchanges world wide making the coin very easy to use, transfer and swap making it perfect for our payouts.

Often times the process to stake your crypto is a very confusing and complicated process.  You are required to transfer coins around multiple times, usually needing a different token first to be used to pay the fees for the transactions to obtain your token of choice.  All of this must be done and sent over the correct blockchain network otherwise if done incorrectly you risk losing all of your funds.  On top of that, most liquidity pool services and staking service providers are riddled with fees and confusing reward structures. Latinum Finance tries to simplify the entire staking process from the ground up. Using coinbase to perform our token transfers users never have to worry if they are sending their funds over the right network or not.  Everyone is provided with a URL(ex. LatinumFinance.github.io/ Wallet_Name) they can use to track their Staked funds with extreme accuracy. Utilizing Microsoft Excel a spreadsheet is embedded into each wallet URL updated with the users current holdings and future earnings. We pride ourselves on being the most transparent staking service in the industry!
