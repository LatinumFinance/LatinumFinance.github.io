Purchase a planet for your crypto ecosystem by sending the exact amount of tokens to the listed wallet address to be staked for passive income rewards!


`*USE THE SAME WALLET ADDRESS YOU USED TO REGISTER YOUR ECOSYSTEM ON DISCORD*`

`*MAKE SURE TO SEND YOUR TOKENS TO THE CORRECT WALLET ADDRESS USING THE RIGHT NETWORK! FUNDS SENT TO THE WRONG ADDRESS OR OVER THE WRONG NETWORK CAN NOT BE RECOVERED*`

_*Orders recieved that differ from the amount total or do not match any registered wallet adresses will be sent back to the same address less the gas cost used*_

`*All STAKED TOKENS CAN BE UNSTAKED AT ANY TIME BUT REQUIRE CERTAIN UNSTAKING TIME PERIODS*`

##### Why no Metamask?

To be able to grow and offer the widest range of assets possible in the crypto industry we choose to go with a unconnected wallet address system.  Trying to figure out how to transfer tokens around using specific wallets and blockchain networks is a serious hurdle for a lot of users. Not only does it cut down on gas fees to participate, but we felt that by eliminating this hurdle and accepting tokens from any exchange or wallet you happen to be hodling your tokens on we would expand this exciting and lucrative part of the crypto world to a lot more people. Users can always keep track of their staked assets and rewards on their individual ecosystem web pages.
