# Latinum Finance

Latinum Finance allows you to earn passive income on your current cryptocurrency holdings. When you stake crypto, your assets go towards verifying transactions
and  securing the network. To incentivize staking, the network generates rewards and pays them out to stakers. Staking is the best option for customers looking
to earn passive rewards on their crypto assets! More information about staking and rewards here: [Staking Rewards System](./CosmosEcosystem)  

## Registering a Ecosystem

`Plan and purchase the planets for your Ecosystem` 

`*USE THE SAME WALLET ADDRESS USED TO REGISTER YOUR ECOSYSTEM*`

`*Orders recieved that differ from the amount total or do not match any registered wallet adresses will be sent back to the same address less the gas cost used*`

>Step 2:
>

`Choose your favorite crypto ecosystem and token that you plan to stake in order to purchase a planet for your crypto ecosystem`

>Step 3:

`Locate that token on the Latinum Finance website to double check the availability, network used, wallet address and required token quantity`
