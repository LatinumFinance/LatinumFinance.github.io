# Latinum Finance

Latinum Finance allows you to earn passive income on your current cryptocurrency holdings. When you stake crypto, your assets go towards verifying transactions
and  securing the network. To incentivize staking, the network generates rewards and pays them out to stakers. Staking is the best option for customers looking
to earn passive rewards on their crypto assets! More information about staking and rewards here: [Staking Rewards System](./CosmosEcosystem)  

## Registering a Ecosystem

> Step 1:
> 

Join the Discord Server

`Discord Server : 987987987`

>Step 2:
>

Click the `"Make a Ecosystem"` tab in Discord and send the requested information.(name of ecosystem, wallet address's, etc...) 
Congratulations! You have just created your Latinum Finance Ecosystem! 


## Building your Ecosystem

>Step 1:
>

Plan and purchase the planets for your Ecosystem 

`*USE THE SAME WALLET ADDRESS USED TO REGISTER YOUR ECOSYSTEM*`

`*Orders recieved that differ from the amount total or do not match any registered wallet adresses will be sent back to the same address less the gas cost used*`

>Step 2:
>

`Choose your favorite crypto ecosystem and token that you plan to stake in order to purchase a planet for your crypto ecosystem`

>Step 3:
>

`Locate that token on the Latinum Finance website to double check the availability, network used, wallet address and required token quantity`

>Step 4:
>

`Purchase a planet for your crypto ecosystem by sending the exact amount of tokens to the listed wallet address to be staked for passive income rewards!`

`*MAKE SURE YOU SEND YOUR TOKENS USING THE CORRECT WALLET ADDRESS AND NETWORK! FUNDS SENT TO THE WRONG ADDRESS OR NETWORK CAN NOT BE RECOVERED*`

`*All STAKED TOKENS CAN BE UNSTAKED AT ANY TIME BUT REQUIRE A 3 DAY UNSTAKING PERIOD* Find out more about unstaking your assets here: [Unstaking my Assests](./CosmosEcosystem)`
